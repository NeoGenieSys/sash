> The nice thing about standards is that you have so many to choose from. *&mdash; Andrew S. Tanenbaum*

### Overview

SASH is a replacement standard for MPEG DASH's manifest format. Its aims are to provide a simpler, JSON based manifest format which learns from DASH's manifest design, but delivers something very Javascript and Media Source Extension friendly.

### Examples

* [Simple 1 Audio, 1 Video minimal manifst for VOD content.](sash-single-audio-single-video-vod-only.json)

### Is this a Joke?

No, we're 100% serious.
